# Bug-reports
Pending and filed big reports for various software (in ‘Issues’ section) - feel free to add to existing issues and submit pull requests.

## Why
I created this for my own personal use. It is public in case I forget about / work around a problem before submitting a bug report, so others may potentially benefit.
